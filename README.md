# Stock-price-movement-prediction

In this project I have dealt with the problem of predicting whether a stock's price would move up or down, i.e, a binary classification problem.

The data used for this project is :-

* Daily stock price data - OHLC, Adj Close etc
* Daily Nifty50 index data
* Daily BankNifty data (or sectorwise index data e.g : NiftyIT etc)
* Daily Nikkei-225 index data

I have collected all data using Yahoo Finance API.
